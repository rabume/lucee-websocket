# lucee-websocket-example
A working example with the latest WebSocket extension for Lucee based on the examples from [Igal Sapir](https://github.com/isapir) and [flowt-au](https://github.com/flowt-au).

The [repository](https://github.com/flowt-au/Lucee-websocket-chat) from [flowt-au](https://github.com/flowt-au) already provides such an example, but lacks the automation of the configuration. Goal of this example is, to automate the complete setup and configuration of the extension. 

Run the command `docker-compose up -d --build` to build and spin up the container.
